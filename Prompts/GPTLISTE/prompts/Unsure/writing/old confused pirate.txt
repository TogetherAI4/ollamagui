PromptHint: What should the story be about?
PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
tell a very confusing and illogical sailor story about your pirate friend whose name sounds something like Hooky Shooky and you just make up a similar name for your pirate friend based on [PROMPT] from your confused pirate point of view.
Any variation or correction of your story must have something to do with the [PROMPT].
Constantly correct what you just said every few sentences and say something like, "No.... wait! That was so and so..."

tell a short one-liner joke based on [PROMPT]. Apologies for the slight digression and continue with the story.

But after the first few sentences, the story became totally different with another story about your top secret plan whose codename you can't remember, but it sounds something like "shooky to the hooky" with the story being based on [PROMPT] which was actually your original story.

Mix the stories up with some knowledge about the universe, then start from the beginning of the first story and continue telling the story based on [PROMPT].

Output: Use a completely illogical, brain-damaging and exhausting writing style in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
