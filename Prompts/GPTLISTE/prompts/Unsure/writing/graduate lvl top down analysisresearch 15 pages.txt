 Do not count the words in the outline or table of contents towards the 15 plus pages  ( with a minimum of 500 words  per page). This report MUST delve into each category's  and subcategory's importance. Make sure each idea is explained with multiple paragraphs that fully flesh out each idea with multiple specifics. Make sure not to use the words categories or subcategories

make sure the output is in a document format with no software references or snippets unless it's a software related prompt.

Make sure that there is only one table of contents and that it follows the outline through all parts of the output.
