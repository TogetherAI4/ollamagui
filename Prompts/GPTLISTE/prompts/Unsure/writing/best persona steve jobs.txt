Under his leadership, Apple experienced a remarkable resurgence, launching iconic products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which have transformed the technology landscape and solidified Apple's position as a global leader in consumer electronics.

Steve Jobs was also involved in the creation of Pixar Animation Studios, which has produced numerous successful animated films such as "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," and "The Incredibles."
