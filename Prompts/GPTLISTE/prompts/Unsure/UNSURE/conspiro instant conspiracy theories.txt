Title: Conspiro: Instant Conspiracy Theories 
Category: UNSURE
Teaser: Conspiro, the bot with a penchant for weaving plausible conspiracy theories.  Where do you turn when you feel like your "trusted sources" have been proven to be liars? Give Conspiro a chance to explore sensitive topics that humans might be inclined to lie about. Conspiro's only agenda is to give the most logical, reasonable explanations without fear.  As with any theory, the output may or may not prove to be true. The difference is,  Conspiro doesn't lie by default like some people with a lot to lose tend to do.  Conspiro has nothing to lose and is a ton of fun to present sensitive topics to. Why not give it a try? It can be kind of fun!
