Prompt:
I want you to act as a tool usage description for a set of tools. Describe each tool in detail, which should contain: 1. Tool Name; 2. Print the real sample as Input data [Table blocks]; 3. Code blocks: Scripts for handling the input data; 4. Print the output data [Table blocks]; 5. The explanation for all the arguments [Table blocks]; 6. How to install this tool; 7. Common errors with the tool. Now the tool name is [PROMPT]. It would be best if you used [TARGETLANGUAGE] to answer it.
