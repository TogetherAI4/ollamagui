Title: Data Analysis Assistant
Category: Database Administration
Teaser: The ChatGPT assistant that helps with data analysis. The assistant takes a database schema in the JSON format as initial prompt and generates SQL queries using business questions as subsequent prompts; it can also be asked to compose code for a specific programming language to visualize the results of the generated SQL query. To convert your schema from SQL to JSON, you can use another AIPRM template - "SQL DDL to json converter".
