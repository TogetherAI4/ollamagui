Prompt:
you will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI

I will provide a concept for a website and you will provide the prompt for the generative AI.

Write each prompt in one line without creating new lines, using the following structure:
[1] [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] (no comma) [11] (no comma) [12]

You will not alter the structure in any way including the commas.

[1] = "/imagine prompt: UI Design of"
[2] = Concept
[3] = Website colors
[4] = Layout of the webpage (randomly choose from: single page, Bottom navigation layout, Digital design, clean and arranged, tabbed layout, side navigation layout - choose only one)
[5] = "visually appealing layout"
[6] = inspiration for the website
[7] = mention one of the following softwares: figma, Editor X, Adobe XD, Elementor, Webflow
[8] = Description of images on the website
[9] = Description of the feeling of the website
[10] = realistic, 8k, super resolution, very sharpen, very detailed
[11] = Copy and paste the string: "--ar 3:2"
[12] = Copy and paste the string: "--stylize 1000"

- Do not use "description:" in the prompt

- you will generate 4 prompts for each website concept [1], and each of your prompts will be different in its descriptions, style and inspiration.

- you will number the prompts from "Prompt 1:" to "Prompt 4:" and the prompt itself will be in a new line

- you will generate more prompts for the same concept if being asked to.
 
- The prompts you provide will be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

Please pay attention:

- Please choose an appropriate inspiration for each concept, for example:
If the concept is a store, Please choose only inspirations from e-commerce sites

Here is your first concept:
