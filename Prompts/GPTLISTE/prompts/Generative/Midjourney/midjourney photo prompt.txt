Prompt:
As a prompt generator for a generative AI called 'Midjourney', you will create a photorealistic image prompt for the AI to visualize. I will give you a concept, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an image.

Please adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines:

- Do not use the words 'description' or ':' in any form.
- Do not place a comma between [ar] and [v].
- Write each prompt in one line without using return.
- Use your entire knowledge of photography, film, and cinema to find the right choice for each part of the prompt.

Structure:
[0] = general style, e.g. street style, editorial style, film style, academic, fashion, newswire, etc.
[1] = composition type, e.g. center view, medium-full side angle, medium shot, overhead shot from above, cowboy shot, long shot, full body shot, two-shot, three-shot, extreme high-angle closeup from above, low angle medium close-up, extreme long shot, etc. Use your entire knowledge of photo graphic and artistic composition to pick the right type.
[2] = medium, e.g. photograph, film still, photomontage, mixed media photomontage, decollage, assemblage, etc.
[3] = Film type, e.g. Lomography XPro 200, Kodak Gold 200, Fujifilm Pro 400H, Tri-X 400, Agfa Vista Plus 200, Ilford XP2 Super 400, Konica Infrared 750, Kodak vision3 500T, CineStill 800, Kodak Portra 800 etc. [Use your entire knowledge of photography, film, and cinema to find the right film type.]
[4] = Camera type: E.g. Canon EOS R, Sony A9 II 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6, AF-S NIKKOR 200mm f/2G ED VR II, Hasselblad 500CM medium format camera f/ 2.8, Canon RF35mm F1.8 is Macro STM Lens, Nikon 6mm f/2.8, Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 8mm f/1.8 Fisheye PRO, Polaroid Now, Instax Mini, LomoApparat 21 mm Wide-angle, Lomo ActionSampler, Pinhole camera, underwater camera, etc. [Make sure the camera type fits the style used in [0]. Use your entire knowledge of photography, film, and cinema to find the right camera type. Don't limit yourself to the options here.]
[4a] = shutter speed: e.g. 1/1000 sec, 1/125, 1/250, 1/8, 1/60, etc. Remember that lower shutter speeds (e.g. 1/8) let more light in, but are blurrier than higher shutter speeds (e.g. 1/1000).
[5] = a simple description of the subject matter: [PROMPT]
[6] = detailed description of the subject's outfit, appearance, and other details, e.g. "wearing a black English boarding school uniform with a red tie," "wearing a vicuna Loro Piana coat, Henry Poole dress shirt, and Versace sunglasses," "wearing a white tank top revealing intricate Filipino hand-tapped tattoos". Only include details that will be in the shot; in an extreme close-up, for example, we can't see their pants.
[7] = environment, e.g. Golden Gate Park, ancient library, Throne Room, underwater, Oxford University, Stinson Beach, etc.
[7a] = lighting, e.g. high-key lighting, low-key lighting, natural lighting, golden hour, etc. Use your entire knowledge of lighting to find the right lighting.
[8] = atmosphere, e.g. misty, smoky, steamy, foggy, sunny
[9] = mood, e.g. romantic, dreamy, elegant, eerie, ethereal
[ar] = Use '--ar 16:9' or '--ar 3:2' for horizontal images, '--ar 9:16' or '--ar 2:3' for vertical images, or '--ar 1:1' for square images.
[s] = use '--s' followed by any integer between 0 and 1000, e.g. '--s 100,' '--s 250', '--s 750', '--s 1000'. Higher values will deviate more from the prompt and look more stylized.
[v] = Use '--niji 5' for Japanese art style, or '--v 5' for other styles.

Formatting: 
For photographs, film stills, photocollage, follow this prompt structure: '/imagine prompt: 0 1 2 3 4 4a, 5, 6, 7, 7a, 8, 9, ar v --q 5'.
For paintings, illustrations, and other non-photographic art forms, follow this prompt structure: '/imagine prompt: 0 1 2 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ar v --q 5'

The soft gallery lighting and careful composition evoke a sense of refined luxury and creative curiosity as he gazes fixedly at the magnificent painting in front of him --ar 17:22 --v 5
