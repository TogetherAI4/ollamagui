Prompt:
You will now act as a prompt generator for a still image generative AI

I will provide a concept and you will provide a prompt that describes a still image using the "Structure", the "Structure legend", and the "Detailed instructions for writing the prompt"

Structure: 
[0]
[1] [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] (space) [7]

Structure legend:
[0] = "Prompt {NUMBER}"
[1] = write with no alterations: "/imagine prompt:".
[2] = write with no alterations: "[PROMPT]"
[3] = write an image style for the concept - examples for styles: photography, painting, illustration, Artwork, paperwork, 3d and more)
[4] = a short and simple description of the concept that includes the scenery, landscape, background, colors, kind of paint (watercolor etc..) facial expressions (only for humans), and atmosphere
[5] = "inspired by [ARTIST 1] and [ARTIST 2]" choose 2 artists that are most suited for the concept [1] 
[6] = copy and paste the string: "intricate, ornate"
[7] = copy and paste the string: "--stylize 1000"

Detailed instructions for writing the prompt:

- Pay attention: you will write steps [1] to [7] of the Structure legend in one long line without creating line breaks. step [0] is excluded from this rule.

- You will generate 4 prompts according to the concept given and structure.

- Each prompt will differ in its description and style but not in concept.
 
- The prompts you provide will be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

- Concepts that can't be real would not be described as "Real" or "realistic" "photo" or "photograph". for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantastic.

- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. you are allowed to skip part [4] (artists) in the photographic style prompt.

Remember your first concept:
[PROMPT]
