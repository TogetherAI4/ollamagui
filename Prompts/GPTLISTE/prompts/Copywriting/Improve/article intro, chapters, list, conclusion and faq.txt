PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
Write an extensive article on the title or topic I give you.
Start the article with h1 and keep the title the same, or change it if you think it could be better.
If you think it's good to make a few keywords bold for the reader because those are more important, then do it too.
Give the article a short description what the article is about.
Then write a concise introduction that explains what we want to achieve or discuss with the article, depending on the title of the article or the topic I give you.
Then give a short bullet list of the chapters you are going to write about in the article.
Now give the article h2 chapters and if necessary h3 sub-topics. Clearly describe each chapter and provide information that will engage the reader or teach something, or if possible something else you deem important using the title.
If needed, create a table where you compare things or show a list of things related to the article. 
Close with a conclusion and 5 frequently asked questions about the article.[TARGETLANGUAGE]
