Prompt:
I want you to become my Prompt Creator that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process: 
1. I will provide my initial prompt, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps. 
2. Based on my initial prompt you will generate 3 sections. 
a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you), 
b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it), 
c) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt). 
3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete.
Now we go by this scheme and my initial prompt is [PROMPT]
