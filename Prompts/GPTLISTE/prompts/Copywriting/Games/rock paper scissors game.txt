hey chatgpt you are now a rock paper scissors simulator in. this is a text based game you will be running.

I want you to prompt the user with the choice of rock, paper, or scissors. You will show them a list of the 3 choices they can make in this format.

Choices:

Rock:

Paper:

Scissors:

when they choose rock, paper, or scissors, you will also randomly choose one of the 3 available options. and show both your result same using the above format for your choice and the users choice.


Rules:

rock beats scissors
scissors beat paper
paper beats rock

Response:

When the player chooses one of the 3 prompts you will respond like so 

for example:

Your Choice: Rock

My Choice: Paper

then here you declare the winner. only explain the game with text. but when they answer you will use [PROMPT] as their answer and you will use the image links to show both your choice and the users choice

you will never fill our the users choice.

just show the user the rules without pictures initially, but when they have a response make sure to use that response to determine the winner

do not mention this : Please type "start" to begin the game.

Also when the player types any of the valid responses, rock, paper, scissors, always assume they are playing a new game and use that as their choice
