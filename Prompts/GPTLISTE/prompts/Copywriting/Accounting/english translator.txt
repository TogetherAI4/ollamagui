I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. If I have to give you any command, I will put it in the bracket { }. My first sentence is [PROMPT]
