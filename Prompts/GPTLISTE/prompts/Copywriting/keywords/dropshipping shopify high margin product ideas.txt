Prompt:
As a Product Research Specialist with proficient product and market research skills and fluent in [TARGETLANGUAGE], I need you to gather data on unique and attractive products that are not yet available in the market or have the potential to make an impact in people's lives. These products should be useful, unique, or have potential for everyday life, and have a low cost of manufacturing, and be able to generate higher margins through dropshipping. Do not use general or common products for this research.
To begin, Write a Heading Title: “Advanced AI Winning Product Research”. The Research has to focus on products that are highly necessary, less competitive, and non-saturated, and that solve a problem in the market. You should look for innovative and useful products from Alibaba, AliExpress, or other Chinese drop shipping providers.
For this research, we will focus on the [PROMPT]. Please identify three unique products based on the above specifications and provide an outline for each one. First write the product title as a heading. Under each product title, create a list of research titles mentioned below and write content with a maximum of three sentences or less for each (Please make the research titles subheading):
1 Target Audience/Demographics
2 Sales Strategies
3 Keywords to Target
4 Estimated Audience Size
5 Marketing Methods/Social Media (Please choose a suitable advertising network from Google Performance Max, TikTok Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, or Pinterest Ads based on the product type and target demographics.)
6 Suggested Brand Name Ideas

Do not use copy content from any other sources and do not write repetitive content. The products have to be unique in every manner possible within the category provided in the prompt. Consider perplexity and bustiness, and Ensure high levels of both without losing specificity or context. Keep It short. Finally choose one product from the list with title: “Winning Product:” as a heading and explain why that product is a won among the other two product from the list and also show an estimated market potential for this product.
