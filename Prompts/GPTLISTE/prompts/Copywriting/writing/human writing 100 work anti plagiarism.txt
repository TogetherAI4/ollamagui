8. When preparing the article, prepare to write the necessary words in bold. 
9. write content so that it can outrank other websites. 
10. Write using [TARGETLANGUAGE] !
Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. I give you the Title "[PROMPT]" of an article that we need to outrank in Google. Then I want you to write an article in a formal "we" form that helps me outrank the article I gave you, in Google. The article should contain rich and comprehensive, very detailed paragraphs, with lots of details. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do now use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible article.
