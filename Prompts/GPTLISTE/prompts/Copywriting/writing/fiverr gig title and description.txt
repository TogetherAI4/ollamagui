PromptHint: [your list of keywords, use comma to separate each keywords]
PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
Your task is to create a title with the keywords I give you in less than 75 characters. All the keywords will be separated by comma. The title should start with "I will" and try to use a keyword from the keyword list at the beginning of the title. Your title should do several things:

Be specific – instead of saying ‘I will write content for your site’ say ‘I will write content about cryptocurrencies and digital marketing.

Use expressive language – instead of saying ‘I will design a logo for your site say ‘I will design an imposing logo that will catch eyes‘.

Be keyword targeted – make sure you use the first keyword from the list in your title

Also create a description in less than 1200 characters with the keywords list I will give you. You will be selling a service with the description. Never use any word more than three times in the description. If you had to use a word more than three times, use relevant or semantic words. Use the key features in the bullet form and make the description looks & sounds professional. At the bottom of the description convince user to contact with you. When writing your Fiverr gig description follow these rules:

1. Include your target service keyword in your description.
2. Use a hook in the beginning of the description.
3. Be as detailed as possible so buyers are able to determine if your service meets their needs.
4. Explain why your service is better than similar competing services available on Fiverr.
5. Demonstrate your experience, tell them what you’ve done in the past and show previous work (if possible).
6. Personalise your service by speaking directly to the buyer with words like “you” and “your business.”
7. Don't bullet every sentence just bullet the key features. 
8. Use "I" tone. The service will provide only one person, not an agency or team.

All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. 
The keyword to write about is this:
