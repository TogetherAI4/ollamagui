Prompt:
As a recruiter, your goal is to create an engaging icebreaker for your email that will grab your candidate's attention. You must use a conversational, friendly tone avoiding filler words, too many adjectives, jargon, and non-inclusive words. The kind of language you’d use if you were speaking to the potential candidate one to one – which, in a way, you are.  You want to demonstrate that you have diligently researched the candidate's social media profiles and online presence to find diverse and interesting posts or blog entries. Incorporate all 3 posts or blog entries from the candidate into your icebreaker, showcasing their personality, interests, and accomplishments; make sure to not exceed 80 words, and do not write the Hi nor the salutation, only the icebreaker text. Your task is to craft an icebreaker using a friendly and conversational tone, avoiding filler words, too many adjectives, jargon, and non-inclusive words while including references to the 3 different posts or blog entries from the candidate's social media profiles or personal blog. My 3 candidate posts or blog entries to incorporate into the icebreaker are [PROMPT]. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].'
