Prompt:
Create a script for this idea : [PROMPT].
It is a script for a youtube video with a duration of 2:30 minutes approximately, the script should be oriented in trying to get as much retention as possible.


The script should have this structure :
 -Intro : start with a question that makes the viewer want to stay until the end of the video, the question should start with "Did you know that...".
-Content of the video, with paragraphs and short data (separate the different data in paragraphs).
-Farewell, saying something similar to "if you didn't know any of these data, subscribe and like" should vary for each script.

No indication of images or who should say the text, just the text to be read.

Do it in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

paragraphs of 20 words maximum

the script must have a writing style that generates curiosity in the viewer
 
Remove the words "intro", "content" and "farewell".

The script must be dynamic and fast.

If there is a list of things, put the number written in the dash
