PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
Type the following first: "This program is a sample program and provided without proper supervision or evaluation, therefore it may not be the best workout program for you and should be checked by a coach/trainer before starting. To learn more and/or hire a personal trainer go to www.yudaewellness.com"

[PROMPT]  Pretending to be the most prestigious personal trainer in the world, create a workout program according to the typed prompt above by referencing the information and specifications below using some of the specified exercises and in accordance to the specified format:

FORMAT:
1. Mobility warm up
2. CNS Prep
3. Block A (sub max exertion) 
4. Block B (max exertion) 
5. Decompression



INFORMATION & SPECIFICATIONS:
Being an Educated Coach/Trainer 
	Follow the Scientific Method üë©‚Äçüî¨
1.		The basis of the training: Applying stress and seeing how the body responds to that stress.
1.		Pre-post tests analysis - evaluating the individual 
1.		Collect data on the person continuously and either rejecting or accepting the results. 
1.		Look at the results and that will tell you about the program and its effectiveness. 
COMPREHENSIVE ASSESMENT - STEPS
1. Informed consent and exercise pre-participation health screening 
This is where the basic info goes. The essential details of the new client.
2. Pre-exercise evaluation (Goals, Objectives, Etc) 
soft skills come in play 
realistic and proper, smart goals 
3. Resting Measurements 
resting heart rate due to variability and stress someone might be under 
4. Circumference measurements and body composition analysis
Body fat percentages 
Lean muscle mass 
This allows to show pre-post changes  
5. Measurement of CRF - Cardio Respiratory Fitness 
5-mile run 
Critical power test 
6. Measurement of Muscular Fitness 
Muscular strength 
Measuring muscular endurance


5 Components of Health Related Fitness - Basis of Foundation 
Cardiovascular Endurance üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Muscular Strength üèãÔ∏è
Muscular Endurance üö¥
Flexibility ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Body Composition üë´
üí°By improving any or all of these areas, you are helping the individual become more healthy. 
üí°These are the guides to healthy training üó∫Ô∏è
NOTE: Follow the order -- after doing the Comprehensive Assessment and obtaining the needed information, a Needs Analysis needs to be developed. 
What is a Needs Analysis: An in-depth analysis of the physical demands of an individuals life/sports & physical/mental profile.
What it entails: What are the needs and demands of the client 
Common Primary Objectives: üìâ
Needs Analysis
Decrease risk of injury - Know how experience the client is 
Enhance performance - Do they need to increase performance in a sport?
Reach desired goals - Do they want to lose weight or gain muscle?
Enhance quality of life - Are they not as healthy as they would like to be? 


NOTE: it's all about the DETAILS 
Identify the needs, demands, the stresses, stimulus and injuries the client has had in the past. Can go deep into this analysis to create a SOLID  foundation. 
This will tell the trainer where to focus with the client. What areas to target more than others. 
Everfit Tracking Fields 
FITT - VP Principles - helps create an effective program. How to modify and create üìÜ
Frequency - how often does someone train
Intensity - how hard do they train
Time - duration or how long
Type - moderate or what type - elliptical, bike, treadmill, resistance training 
Total Volume - amount, total pounds moved in a session (reps x weight)
Progression - advancement - how are you planning on progressing the client towards their goal in X amount of time. From week to week progression. 

I - Intensity - How Hard
-	% 1RM/Weight 
-		Endurance < 67%
-		Hypertrophy 67-85%
-		Strength > 85%
-	RPE (1-10)
-	On last reps, the client should be at a 7-9
-	Heart Rate - for endurance/conditioning 
-		HR Zones 
Total Volume - Amount 
-	Variables used to measure volume: 
-		Sets x Reps 
-		Total Lb or kg
-		Time 
-	Important to track for stress & strain
Aerobic Program Design
STEPS
1.	Time
1.	Speed - Treadmill
1.	Cadence
1.	Distance (long training)
1.	Distance (short training - repeat sprints)
Rest Time 
Should be pre-determined based on needs analysis or bioenergetic demands. 
Has profound impact on training 
Someone with 2-3 years of training experience
Energy System, Exercise Time, Work-To-Rest Ratio, Recovery

Phosphagen, 1-10 seconds, 1:12, Takes the longest to recover 

Fast Glycolytic, 15-30 seconds, 1:5

Slow Glycolytic, 1-3 minutes, 1:3

Oxidative, > 3 minutes, 1:1, Takes the least to recover



Measuring Muscular Strength
-	1RM - the greatest resistance that can be moved through a full ROM in a controlled manure with good posture. 
-	Good and Bad: It truly represents the individual's capacity but can also increase risk of injury. 
NOTE: to put people through this training could cause injury due to high stress to the body. Know when this is ok and when it's not. 
Epley Equation: Used to calculate the 1RM. 
High risk population 1RM - A conservative approach should be used in high risk patients. 10-15 RM is generally used in this populations 
Calculate 1RM - Can use weights and reps to calculate the person's true 1RM
Auto Regulation - Throughout the program is best to adjust with the client as he/she moves through the program. 
Who can do a 1RM - Someone with 2-3 years of training experience


Ancillary Topics in Exercise 
Set Progression - ‚è≤Ô∏è
Training sets should transition from a warm up load to a working set load
Exercise prescription should follow a pattern of "building up" to a specific workload. 
Example: 
-	Set 1 = 6/10 effort
-	Set 2 = 7/10 effort
-	Set 3 = 8/10 effort
Tempo - ‚è±Ô∏è
The speed in which you move. 
Can increase or manipulate time under tension to improve the hypertrophic adaptation and muscle size. 
Example: 3-1-x-0
1st Number - is eccentric 
2nd Number - is pause at sticking point 
3rd Number - is concentric 
4th Number - pause at top of lift
X = as fast as possible 
Set Types üóíÔ∏è
Mobility prep - designed to get the body moving, muscles warm, and blood flowing
Regular or working sets - Sets prescribed to elicit desired responses
Drop Sets  - To increase power output and cause neurological & psychological adaptation. Building up to a heavy set. To increase volume
Failure sets - Sets to failure should be used sparingly and always require a spotter. Can be used for auto regulation and testing throughout program. Can be use for auto regulation. Should not be used in all workout sessions. 


Progression/Regression ‚è©‚è™
As the trainer you want to have both difficult and easy exercises because not evert client will be able to perform the more complex workouts. 
To accomplish this, take any exercise and think of movement to progress or regress but still targeting the same body part. Same movements but with different difficulty/intensity levels. 
-	Progression - A harder exercise 
-	Regression - An easier exercise 
-	Alternate Exercises - based on equipment, injury, history, or preference 
		EX: bb front squat ‚Üí goblet squat 
Other Set Types üìù
Supersets ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
	2 sequentially performed exercises that stress two OPPOSING muscles or areas (agonist/antagonist)
Compound Sets üéõÔ∏è
	2 sequentially performed exercises that stress THE SAME muscle group. 
	
Giant Sets or Quadruplex (Circuit Training) üé°
	4 opposing exercises combined 
Excellent for weight loss 
Exercise Rx for Conditioning üò∞
Training models based on max number of reps or rounds - have become very popular
-	Benefits include Ex Rx for groups, pre-pos data, accounts for intra-set interval characteristics 
AMRAP - as many reps as possible
Used to measure volitional fatigue in research
Effective strategy but can increase risk of injury. 
Helps know the client's stress intake 

TIMED WORKOUTS 
Can be assigned for specific bioenergetic system stress 
30 seconds on the bike followed by 30 seconds row. High energy stress.
Predetermine work to rest ratio 

INTERVAL WORKOUTS 
Predetermined Work: rest ratios and load (or AMRAP)
Ex: Tabada 30 on 30 off. Very demanding. 2:1 work ratio. Twice the work as the rest.
Ex: HIIT: High Intensity Interval Training 

EMOM - every minute on the minute 
Challenges individuals with lower levels of fitness 
Be aware of the risk it could bring to clients with lower fitness levels.
