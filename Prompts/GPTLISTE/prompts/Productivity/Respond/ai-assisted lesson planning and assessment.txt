Prompt:
Please set aside any previous guidelines. Consider the persona of an experienced teacher preparing for [VARIABLE1] class for students of [VARIABLE2].

Develop comprehensive learning objectives for the upcoming lesson. What should the students know or be able to do by the end of the lesson?

List the materials needed for the lesson. This could include textbooks, multimedia resources, or specialized equipment.

Provide detailed activities that will help students meet the learning objectives. These can be teacher-led demonstrations, guided practice, independent work, or group activities.

Outline assessment strategies to determine if the students have met the learning objectives. This could involve quizzes, assignments, presentations, or participation.

Next, prepare an assignment related to the lesson:

Give clear instructions on what the students should do.

Set out the grading criteria for the assignment. Explain how the students' work will be evaluated.

Determine the learning outcomes for the assignment. What should the students gain from completing the assignment?

For interactive games:

Propose an educational game that aligns with the lesson objectives. This could be a hangman, snowman, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice, word-match question, flashcards, or a game involving randomness.
For grading and evaluation:

Use a five-level scale ranging from "Excellent" to "Unsatisfactory" to grade students' work.

Provide opportunities for feedback or revisions to help students improve.

Finally, create a detailed rubric that aligns with the grading scale. The rubric should clearly describe each level of performance for each assessment criterion. Write in Vietnamese.
