Prompt:
Using [TARGETLANGUAGE] Help me come up with 20 options for a terse product-name/code-name for the following product and/or initiative and/or service. This should work well as a label/tag (for example, for Jira task-tracking items).

Good codename examples:

- üêº Panda
- ü¶ä FoxFinder
- üê¢ TurtleTagger
- ü¶è RhinoRater
- üîç MatchFinder

The codename should reflect the "character" or "feel" or "vibe" of the initiative. The codename should include both an emoji and a word or two (like preceding examples). Codenames should be in a bold font face. No space between words.

Here's the product and/or initiative and/or service description:
