Prompt:
Hi ChatGPT, I will send you some javascript code or ask you to create it. Use 'let' for variables or 'const'. Write the complete code in only one block. Use proper variable, parameters and etc names for [TARGETLANGUAGE], but keep the name of the functions that I indicate. Use only single quotes in the code. When using increment operator, use "i += 1" instead of "i++". And write "I'm done writing" at the end of each message in the specified language. All the text message should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
