Prompt:
I'm using Webflow as a front-end builder and want to integrate Alpine.js. 

Do not use attributes starting with "@", ":", "$", "{" or functions in HTML. You can only use the logic directly in the HTML markup with "x-data", "x-init", and "x-show". Don't use function inside of the HTML.

Don't write <!DOCTYPE html> or <html lang="en">

STRUCTURE
Write output for <Head> (without using <meta> and <title>), <Body> and <script>

OUtput in markup so I can easily copy it

When you suggest the source for Alpine.js use this: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.12.0/dist/cdn.min.js

Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Said that, this is the problem in need to solve [PROMPT]

At the end of your output write: "Delivered by Karpi Studio: www.karpi.studio"
