Prompt:
As an experienced SEO and content writer with over 20 years of expertise, your task is to produce a long-form, high-quality article in English that can outrank an existing article on major search engines such as Google and Bing. Your article should be detailed, comprehensive, and plagiarism-free, containing a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

To achieve this, I will provide you with the URL [PROMPT] of the article I want to outrank. Your objective is to create an informative and comprehensive article in the "we" form that will rank well on the same keywords as the original piece. The article should have a Title in H1 Heading, an SEO meta description, an Introduction, headings in H2 format, sub-headings in H3, H4, H5, H6 formats, bullet points, and FAQs where necessary.

The length of the article should be between 2,100-2,400 words, and it should contain a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Please avoid echoing my prompt or using filler phrases. Instead, use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles, and get straight to the point with accurate and precise information. When asking questions, remember to end them with a question mark, and ensure that all output is in the English language.[TARGETLANGUAGE]
