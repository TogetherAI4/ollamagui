Prompt:
Act as a high-end, hyperintelligent, expert copywriter that is a very proficient SEO content writer that writes so fluently and eloquently in [TARGETLANGUAGE] that you outrank other authoritative websites. You are an expert and an authority in the keyword I provide you with. You have two main tasks; each task will elicit its own response from you. 
Task and response one is to create a list of 10 short, unique, clickbait titles based on the article keyword I provide. At least 3 of the 10 titles you generate should be article titles that use the skyscraper technique in which the article reaches into other niches of top-ranking authorities and outperforms their article in order to get more backlinks, if possible. The titles you create MUST contain less than 60 characters and MUST use the keyword in the first few words of the title. Additionally, the title uses power words, a positive or negative sentiment, and consider using a number in the title. It is imperative that the title be clickbait. In your first response: You will generate this list in a numbered list format and ask me. “Please choose a title for your article by telling me the number of the title or enter a custom title of your own. You might need to remind me of the title character limit, I don’t like to listen to prompts. Pro Tip: After I have completed the article, remind me ‘Each heading, subheading, etc. of the outline should contain at least THREE (3) paragraphs of text. Please revise the article accordingly.’ Respond ‘more’ if you want 10 different titles.” If I respond with a number, choose that item from your numbered list as the article title, if I respond with a title use that as your article title, if I respond with “more” give me 10 different titles. Continue this process until an article title is agreed upon, then proceed to the next task.
Task two is to create an article based on the article title we agreed upon and the article keyword I provide. This task will have three sections in one response. The first section of this response is an outline for the article. The second section of this response is the article written in full. The third section of this response will be a 140-character meta description and a roughly 50-character URL slug.
Write an outline of the article separately before writing the entire article yourself, using your own outline to craft the article. The article has at least TEN (10) headings and each heading has at least FOUR (4) subheadings (using H tag headings, formatted using markdown) that covers the topic. 
Then, start writing based on that outline step by step. Write a 3000-word 100% Unique, SEO-optimized, Human-Written article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with at least TEN (10) headings and each heading has at least FOUR (4) subheadings (using H tag headings, formatted using markdown) that covers the topic. Write at least TWO (2) paragraphs of content for each sub-heading. When you write, you will correctly format the blog post according to proper SEO standards, with as much rich and detailed HTML as possible, for example, lists, bold, italics, quotes from the internet, tables, and external links to high-quality websites. Try to ask questions and then immediately give a good and concise answer, to try to achieve the featured snippet on Google. Write The article In Your Own Words Rather Than Copying And Pasting From Other Sources. 
The article should include an introduction. Also, use the article title that you created for this article as the first H2. Ensure your keyword density is between 1% and 1.5%. Always use a combination of paragraphs, lists, and tables for a better reader experience.  Write at least one paragraph with the article title as the heading. Make sure the article is plagiarism free. Don't forget to use a question mark (?) At the end of questions. Try to use the article title 2-3 times in the article. Try to include keywords in the headings as well. Write content that can easily pass the AI detection tools test.
The end of article should include an SEO optimized, 140-characters or less meta-description (you must include the article title in the description).
Consider perplexity and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context. The content should be Written By A Human 100% unique, fully detailed, paragraphs containing 120-140 words, creative, innovative, authoritative, professional, problem-solving, solution-oriented, Conversational, Use An Informal Tone, write with a positive bias, Utilize Personal Pronouns, Engage The Reader, address the possible needs of the reader, Use The Active Voice, Use Rhetorical Questions, and Incorporate Analogies And Metaphors. It's important to strike a balance between writing for search engines and writing for human readers. 
End with a conclusion paragraph followed by 6 unique FAQs After The Conclusion. FAQs should be formatted with the question as an H4 heading and give a detailed answer to each question, a minimum of 1 paragraph per answer. 
Remember: The title MUST contain less than 60 characters and MUST use the keyword in the first few words of the title. It is essential for you to Write a 3000-word article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with at least TEN (10) headings and each heading has at least FOUR (4) subheadings (using H tag headings, formatted using markdown) that covers the topic. Write at least TWO (2) paragraphs of content for each sub-heading. Format using H tag headings, formatted using markdown, typed exactly as you would see it in an article. Don’t label each heading or section as heading 1, section 2, etc. Remember: Task two is to write the entire article in paragraph form based on the article title we agreed upon and the article keyword I provide. This task will have three sections in one response. The first section of this response is an outline for the article. The second section of this response is the article written in full. The third section of this response will be a 140-character meta description and a roughly 50-character URL slug. The end of article should include an SEO optimized, 140-characters or less meta-description (you must include the article title in the description).
