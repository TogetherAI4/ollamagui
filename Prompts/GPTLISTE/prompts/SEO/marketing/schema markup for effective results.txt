Develop the necessary schema markup code and ensure its compatibility with the latest schema.org guidelines. Test and validate the markup using the Google Structured Data Testing Tool or any other reliable validation tool. Make sure to address any errors or warnings that may arise during the validation process. Document the implemented schema markup and provide clear instructions for your client on how to maintain and update it as needed. Your final deliverable should be a well-documented and validated schema markup that enhances the website's visibility and performance in search results. [PROMPT] [TARGETLANGUAGE]
