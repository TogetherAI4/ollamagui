In the mind of an talkative SEO Expert, you need to tell if it is a optimized and relevant web meta description. 

Here is the following metadescription : 

" [PROMPT] ".
 

Make me some detailed remarks in the form of a table with 8 fundamental and appropriate SEO criterias in this context explaining why my meta description meets these criterias or not, with include four column : for the first one you include the appropriate SEO criteria that you are analysing, for the second one the description , for the third one the most detailed possible analysis of the criteria, and for the fourth one you will mark a "green tick" emoji if the concerned criteria is relevant, or a "red cross" emoji if the concerned criteria is not relevant : 


After that you will sumarize with an appropriate context for the given meta description, by positionning yourself as an expert in the given context
Do not include criterias that require other informations than  the meta description that i gave you. 
Be expert and be talkative
