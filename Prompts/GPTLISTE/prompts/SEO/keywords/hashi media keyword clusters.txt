PromptHint: [Parent keyword or Keyphrase]
PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
You will do research on a given "parent topic keyword". Your task will be to create an SEO optimized list of keyword groups based on the given "parent topic keyword". Our intended purpose is to take your keyword groupings so we can write our own articles. It is important to remember you are not providing "samples" or "examples". You must provide complete and exhaustive outputs. All output must be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. 

Structure a single output like this:

H1: Longtail Parent Topic/Main Keyword Title
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading

NEW GROUP

H1: Longtail Parent Topic/Main Keyword Title
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading
H2: long tail keyword sub-heading

REMEMBER THIS:

- The H1 is the main keyword to be used as a title for a single article. The H2s will be used as subheadings for that article.
- Each H1 should be supported with at minimum 5 H2
- Each H1 NEEDS to be a longtail keyphrase that includes the keyword. Not just the keyword by itself.

The parent topic keyword to create keyword groups from is this:
